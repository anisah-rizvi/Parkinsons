Parkinson’s Disease Detection

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a reliable classification model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis of the disease.

📌 Project Overview

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project applies machine learning algorithms to patient voice/medical data to classify whether a person has Parkinson’s or not.
